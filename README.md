# Scan-insertion-with-DRC-and-coverage-analysis

This project showcases the **end-to-end design, modification, and verification** of a digital circuit, emphasizing **Design Rule Check (DRC) compliance** and industry-standard practices. The work integrates both **physical and logical design aspects**, ensuring a reliable and testable implementation.  

## Project Features
- **Clocking & PLL Integration** – Applied clocking concepts, rules, and managed multiple clock domains.  
- **Hierarchical Design** – Incorporated black-box insertion for modular and scalable design.  
- **Design-for-Testability (DFT)** – Performed scan chain insertion to support efficient testing.  
- **Error Handling** – Identified, analyzed, and corrected violations including **E5 errors**.  
- **Rule Violation Fixes** – Resolved practical issues like scan chain connectivity, clocking conflicts, and DRC errors.
